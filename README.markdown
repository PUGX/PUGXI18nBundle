PUGXI18nBundle
=============

PUGXI18nBundle is a simple way to manage the internationalization in Symfony2 as in symfony1 with a Entity (that implements TranslatableInterface) and EntityI18n (that implements TranslatingInterface) 
via one-to-many association.
In practice when you design the entity that implements TranslatableInterface, you can extend the class TranslatableWrapper or the class Translatable.
The Translatable's function is retrieve the translation for the current locale. 
The TranslatableWrapper's function is to wrap the methods of the related entity (TranslatingInterface) using a "magic call".
If you want "kill the magic", you have to extend Translatable and implement these wrappers by yourself.

The branch master is developed upon Symfony 2.1
